##Overview: The goal of these scripts is to query and process roads data from 
##          tigris to a census tract level road length measure by road class. 
##          This script is used to download TIGER/Line road data for all US counties.
##          The roads are then intersected with census tracts using st_intersection (next file),
##          the length in each tract is calculated with st_length, and then sum
##          road lengths are calculated for each of the unique road classifications.
##          Finally, a nationwide road lenght dataset is constructed.
##
##Purpose:  Use tigris to download all roads for a state.

# The following variables come from the command line when running as bash. Bash
# scripting is a method for expediting processing using a computing cluster.
# To use this code, you would need to separately write a bash script (such as file 1B in the repository)
# that specifies a series of indices which will be used to process multiple states simultaneously
#
# If you are only processing a single state, this is not necessary. The bash script
# language below can be removed, and you can 
# add a line to specify the stateFIPS you would like to process.
